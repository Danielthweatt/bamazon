#bamazon
This is my first app utilizing MYSQL.
##How to Use
Bamazon is run in node:

When bamazon is run, it will display the items 
it has in stock:

The user selects an item to purchase:

Bamazon tells the user what quantity of that 
item is in stock:

The user tells bamazon how many will be purchased:

Bamazon updates the the database with the new stock 
quantity of that item (the number of items purchased 
is subtracted from the original stock quantity) and 
tells the user how much the user has been charged for 
the pruchase:
